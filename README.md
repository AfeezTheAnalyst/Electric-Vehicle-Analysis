# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis

![Vehicle_Power](Vehicle_power_banner.jpg)

## Introduction:
Utilized advanced data analysis tools such as Excel, Power Query, and Power BI to conduct an in-depth examination of alternative power vehicles within the automotive sector. This involved constructing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize intricate details such as manufacturer data, model years, vehicle types, and electric range. Implemented Data Modeling techniques to enhance precision and accuracy, resulting in valuable insights for informed decision-making in the industry.

## About the Dataset:
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). BEV sales during Q2 2023 grew over 50% YoY. One in every 10 cars sold during Q2 2023 was a pure battery electric vehicle (BEV). China remained the leader in global BEV sales followed by USA and Germany. BEV sales in the USA grew by almost 57% YoY, the highest among the top 3 EV markets

*Brief Information About the Features of Dataset:*

- **VIN:** A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is the identifying code for a specific automobile.
- **Country:**. Country where it is Manufactured.
- **City:** location of Company that manufactures Electric Cars.
- **Postal Code:** Pin code is the post office numbering code system used by the postal service.
- **Model Year:** a year in which the car was manufactured.
- **Make** Name of Company.
- **Model:** A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique, 17-digit code specific to every vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type:** When talking about EVs, we generally refer to three main types of electric vehicles: hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle:** Vegetable oils, such as palm, soybean, sunflower, peanut, and olive, as alternative fuels can be used for diesel engines. As an alternative fuel, vegetable oil is one of the renewable fuels.
- **Electric Range:** All-electric vehicles can typically go between 110 and over 300 miles on a single charge. PHEVs can typically go 15â€“60 miles on battery power alone; the fuel tank capacity determines their overall range because the engine kicks in when the battery is depleted.
- **Base MSRP:** Manufacturers set a base price for a car or vehicle without add-on products or features. The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) is the base price plus additional features.
- **Legislative District:** While the Legislature of every State shall consist of the Governor and the State Legislature, in some of the States, the Legislature shall consist of two Houses, namely, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, while in the rest, there shall be only one House, namely the legislative assembly.
- **DOL Vehicle ID:** DOL Vehicle ID. A unique identification number for each vehicle is present in the Transactions dataset. Transactions done on the same vehicle will have the same DOL Vehicle ID.
- **Vehicle Location:** In cases where the vehicle was designed for electric motors, they are generally located at the front and/or rear between the wheels. There are short half-shafts connecting the output of the motors to the wheels.
- **Electric Utility:** A corporation, person, agency, authority, or other legal entity or instrumentality aligned with distribution facilities for delivery of electric energy for use primarily by the public.
- **2020 Census Tract:** Census tracts are relatively permanent small-area geographic divisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity defined for the tabulation and presentation of data from the decennial census and selected other statistical programs

**ANALYSIS:**  

As said before, we would not be considering data that are in the year 2010 downward we want to focus our attention more to recent data which is from 2011 upward. Also, note that this data may not necesarily provide 100% accurate number of vehicles in the two countries. This is because, this data was produced by the state of Washington DC therefore, attention are more focused to the state however they were able to provide some data of other states.
Embark on a journey through the evolution of vehicle production, a narrative woven with numbers and milestones. Picture the humble beginnings in 2011, where a modest fleet of 796 vehicles marks the dawn of a new era. Witness the exponential growth, as 2013 boasts a staggering 4,566 vehicles, igniting optimism and ambition.

Yet, every journey encounters obstacles, and 2014 bears witness to a formidable challenge, as production dips by a formidable 20.1%. But resilience prevails, and by 2018, the landscape transforms once again, with a formidable fleet of 14,441 vehicles symbolizing triumph over adversity.

Fast forward to the horizon of 2023, where the skyline is adorned with 37,079 vehicles, a testament to perseverance and innovation. And as the calendar flips to 2024, the saga continues with 696 vehicles in just the first fortnight of January, a promising prelude to yet another chapter of progress and possibility.

Behold the vibrant tapestry of vehicle distribution, where each state paints a unique hue on the canvas of our nation. Among them, the verdant expanse of Washington emerges as a beacon of automotive abundance, its silhouette cast in a shade of deep emerald on the map of vehicular dominance.

As the eyes wander across the geographical landscape, one cannot help but be drawn to the rich saturation enveloping Washington, a testament to its unrivaled prominence in this automotive odyssey. Like a titan amidst mortals, it stands tall, housing the lion's share of vehicles in this grand narrative.

Indeed, the dark green swath that blankets Washington speaks volumes, echoing the chorus of engines and the hum of progress that resonate throughout its borders. In this symphony of transportation, Washington reigns supreme, its position atop the chart a testament to its enduring legacy in the realm of automotive prowess.
